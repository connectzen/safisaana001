# ✅ Admin-Only Access Setup Complete

## 🎯 What Has Changed

Your dashboard now has **admin-only access**. Only users in the `admins` collection can access anything.

### Your Admin User
- **Email**: `daigavillalimited@gmail.com`
- **User ID**: `fXwik0D5tzXmHGwloEFYjXTGmY12`
- **Access**: Full admin (read, write, update, delete)

## 🔒 How the New System Works

### Admin Check Process

1. **User logs in** with email/password
2. **System checks** `admins/{userId}` collection
3. **If document exists** → User is admin → Access granted ✅
4. **If document doesn't exist** → User is not admin → Login fails with "Access denied" ❌

### What Admin Users Can Do
✅ Login to dashboard
✅ View all data
✅ Upload images
✅ Add videos
✅ Add team members
✅ Update any content
✅ Delete any content

### What Non-Admin Users See
❌ "Access denied. This account does not have admin privileges."
❌ Automatically logged out
❌ Cannot access dashboard
❌ Cannot read/write any data

## 🎨 UI Changes

### Dashboard Sidebar Now Shows:
- User email
- **"Admin" badge** (green pill badge)
- Logout button

### Login Page Now:
- Checks admin status after successful authentication
- Shows "Access denied" error for non-admin users
- Automatically logs out non-admin users

## ➕ Adding More Admin Users

To give someone else admin access:

### Step 1: Create Their Account
1. Firebase Console → **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Click **Add User**
3. Enter their email and password
4. **Copy their User UID** (you'll need this)

### Step 2: Make Them Admin
1. Firestore Database → **admins** collection
2. Click **Add document**
3. Document ID: **(paste their User UID)**
4. Add fields:
   - `email`: (their email)
   - `role`: `admin`
   - `createdAt`: (current timestamp)
5. Save

They can now login with full admin access!

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Don't Lock Yourself Out!
- **ALWAYS** add admin user to Firestore BEFORE deploying rules
- If you deploy rules first, you'll be locked out
- Keep your admin credentials safe

### Security Best Practices
- Don't share admin credentials
- Create separate admin accounts for each person
- Regularly review who has admin access
- Remove admin access when no longer needed

### Backup Plan
If you get locked out:
1. Go to Firebase Console → Firestore Database → Rules
2. Temporarily change rules to allow authenticated users:
   ```javascript
   match /{document=**} {
     allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
   }
   ```
3. Login and add your admin user
4. Re-deploy the admin-only rules
