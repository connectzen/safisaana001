# How to Apply Firebase Security Rules

## ‚úÖ Rules Created
Two rule files have been created in your project root:
- **firestore.rules** - For Firestore Database
- **storage.rules** - For Firebase Storage

Both rules allow **any authenticated user full admin access** (read, write, update, delete).

---

## üìã Method 1: Apply via Firebase Console (Recommended)

### Firestore Rules

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select your project: **saafisana-24c97**
3. Click **Firestore Database** in the left menu
4. Click the **Rules** tab at the top
5. **Delete all existing rules** and paste this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow any authenticated user full access to all documents
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write, update, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

6. Click **Publish**

### Storage Rules

1. In Firebase Console, click **Storage** in the left menu
2. Click the **Rules** tab at the top
3. **Delete all existing rules** and paste this:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';

service firebase.storage {
  match /b/{bucket}/o {
    // Allow any authenticated user full access to all files
    match /{allPaths=**} {
      allow read, write, delete: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

4. Click **Publish**

## üìã Method 2: Apply via Firebase CLI

If you have Firebase CLI installed:

### 1. Install Firebase CLI (if not installed)
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
```

### 2. Login to Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```

### 3. Initialize Firebase (if not already done)
```bash
firebase init
```
- Select: **Firestore** and **Storage**
- Choose: **Use an existing project**
- Select: **saafisana-24c97**
- Use existing rule files: **firestore.rules** and **storage.rules**

### 4. Deploy Rules
```bash
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,storage:rules
```

## üîç Verify Rules Are Active

### Check Firestore Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules
2. You should see the new rules published
3. Check the timestamp to confirm they're recent

### Check Storage Rules
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Rules
2. You should see the new rules published
3. Check the timestamp to confirm they're recent

### Test in Your App
1. Login to your dashboard
2. Try uploading an image
3. Try adding a video
4. Try adding a team member
5. All operations should work without permission errors

---

## üîí What These Rules Do

### ‚úÖ Allow (for authenticated users)
- **Read** - View all data
- **Write** - Create new documents/files
- **Update** - Modify existing documents
- **Delete** - Remove documents/files

### ‚ùå Deny (for non-authenticated users)
- All operations blocked if not logged in

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Note

These rules give **full admin access** to any logged-in user. This is appropriate when:
- ‚úÖ You control who can create accounts (no public signup)
- ‚úÖ All users should have admin privileges
- ‚úÖ You create users manually in Firebase Console

If you need more granular permissions in the future, you can:
- Add role-based access control (admin, editor, viewer)
- Restrict certain collections to specific users
- Add user-specific document access

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### "Permission Denied" Error
- **Cause**: Rules not deployed or user not authenticated
- **Fix**: 
  1. Verify rules are published in Firebase Console
  2. Check user is logged in (check dashboard sidebar for email)
  3. Try logging out and back in

### Rules Not Updating
- **Cause**: Browser cache or rules not published
- **Fix**:
  1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl + Shift + R)
  2. Check Firebase Console shows latest rules
  3. Wait 1-2 minutes for rules to propagate

### Upload Still Failing
- **Cause**: May need to check authentication
- **Fix**:
  1. Open browser console (F12)
  2. Look for specific error messages
  3. Verify Firebase Authentication is enabled
  4. Check you're using the correct Firebase project
