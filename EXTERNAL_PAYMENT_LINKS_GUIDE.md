## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. **Use HTTPS Links Only**
Always use secure HTTPS URLs for payment links.

### 2. **Test Your Links**
Before going live, test each payment link to ensure:
- ✅ It loads correctly
- ✅ The correct price is displayed
- ✅ Payment completes successfully
- ✅ Customer receives confirmation

### 3. **Keep Links Updated**
If you change prices or products in your payment provider:
- Update the payment link in your dashboard
- Update the price field to match

### 4. **Mix and Match**
You can:
- Use external links for some products, internal checkout for others
- Leave payment link empty to use default checkout
- Update links anytime without affecting other products

### 5. **Provider-Specific Tips**

**Stripe:**
- Use Payment Links feature
- Create product in Stripe Dashboard → Get shareable link
- Link format: `https://buy.stripe.com/test_xxxxx`

**Gumroad:**
- Create product → Get product link
- Format: `https://yourname.gumroad.com/l/product-slug`

**Paddle:**
- Create product → Get checkout link
- Format: `https://buy.paddle.com/checkout/xxxxx`
